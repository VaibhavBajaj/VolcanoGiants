#Volcano Giants

**Volcano Giants** is a module that adds a new world Volcano Giants to the list of worlds.
This is a beautiful world with sweet fairies and candy everywhere.... No.

A world mimicking the Underworld itself, it is the true definition of "Hell on Earth"!
It is characterized by sky-high volcanoes with lava veins flowing down their accursed grounds!

When on top, you can see nought but dust, stone and lava.

Don't dig to deep or you shall plummet to your lamented death from hellish Lava!

May God save your soul!
