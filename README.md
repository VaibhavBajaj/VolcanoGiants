#Volcano Giants

**Volcano Giants** is a module that adds a new world Volcano Giants to the list of worlds.
This is a beautiful world with sweet fairies and candy everywhere.... No.

A world mimicking the Underworld itself, it is the true definition of "Hell on Earth"!

1000 years hence, the sky turned red and yellow and demonic gods ascended to Earth. Once the smoke cleared, this world remained. Sky-high volcanoes with lava veins flowing down their accursed grounds now populate this land.

On the top of the volcanoes, you can see nought but volcanic ash, dust, stone and lava and breathe nought but poisonous gas.

However, even here lie hidden gems buried behind solid rock

Don't dig to deep or you shall plummet to your lamented death from hellish Lava!
